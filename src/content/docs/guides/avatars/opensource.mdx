## Open Source Avatars


<Aside type="tip" title="Free CC0">Free vrm resource from @ToxSam</Aside>



"OpenSourceAvatars.com started as a platform showcasing CC0 and open source avatars created by ToxSam since 2018, including the original 200+ VRM avatars from the 100avatars challenge in 2018 and 2020. But we're dreaming bigger now!

Our mission is to transform OpenSourceAvatars.com into the internet's central hub for discovering and downloading high-quality CC0 and Creative Commons 3D avatars. While ToxSam's creations form the foundation of our collection, we're excited to expand by curating and featuring amazing open source avatars from talented creators worldwide. Think of it as a free, accessible library of metaverse-ready characters that anyone can use for games, VR applications, virtual worlds, art projects, or AI training – no strings attached!"
