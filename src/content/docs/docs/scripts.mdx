## Scripting Interface

To open the in world scripting window, right click on a model to inspect it and click script. Save your scripts with `cmd + s` or `ctrl + s` depending on your OS.

## World Hierarchy

Worlds are made up of the following hierarchy:
```
Worlds contain:
  └─ Entities which include:
      ├─ Players which contain:
      |   └─ Nodes (e.g. avatar, joint)
      └─ Apps  which contain:
          └─ Nodes (e.g. mesh, collider, rigidbody)
```

Certain `entity` and `node` attributes within a world can be accesed from the global world API:

- [world](/ref/world)

## Global Entities

Apps run inside their own secure environment, which allow apps built by many different authors to co-exist in a real-time digital world.

Just as websites run inside a DOM-based environment that provides browser APIs via globals, apps are provided with specific APIs for the global app and player entities:

- [app](/ref/app)
- [props](/ref/props)
- [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [num](/ref/num)
- [Vector3](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3)
- [Quaternion](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Quaternion)
- [Euler](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Euler)
- [Matrix4](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Matrix4)


## Nodes

Apps are made up of a hierarchy of nodes that you can view and modify within the app runtime using scripts.
Nodes contain certain default attributes that are inherited by all other nodes such as `node.position` or `node.scale`. Information on the standard node attributes can be found in [Node](/ref/node)

Other node attributes are based on common standards in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with more information found externally below:


## Entity Nodes

When a model is added to a scene, a [group node](/ref/group) is created containing a collection of nodes which mirrors your gltf model hierarchy. It is important to be mindful of these naming conventions when working on a model in software like Blender so you can access these mesh nodes like:

`app.get(<mesh-node-name>)`

If you are importing a model from someplace like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) and you don't know the root model name, you can return it with `const id = app.id`. You can then find the id's of sub meshes by traversing the node hierarchy.

### Creating Nodes

Some nodes can/need to be created using `app.create('<node-name>')`. Information on using each node type and thier attributes can be found below:

**Model**
- [Mesh](/ref/mesh)
- [Material](/ref/material)
- [LOD](/ref/lod)

**Interaction**
- [Action](/ref/action)
- [Collider](/ref/collider)
- [rigidbody](/ref/rigidbody)
- [Controller](/ref/controller)

**UI**
- [UI](/ref/ui)
- [UIText](/ref/ui-text)
- [UIViews](/ref/ui-view)


**Environment**
- [Audio](/ref/audio)
- [Sky](/ref/sky)

**Generic**
- [Group](/ref/group)
- [Node](/ref/node)


## Player Entity

Some nodes are specific to the `player` entity:

- [Avatar](/ref/avatar)
