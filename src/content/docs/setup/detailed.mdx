This will setup a world locally on your machine that you can then [self-host](/hosting/self).

You can start a hosted world from a [hosting provider](/hosting/provider) without needing to setup locally, if you prefer.

This installation page is detailed to help those who might be fresh in some of these things.

While this is as detailed as possible, and should get you going.. if you really want to learn Foundations of Web Development, [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) will teach you a lot - for free!

Once you make it through this `install`, most of what you will do will be directly in your Hyperfy v2 world.  Right now, v2 is still mid-development.  So, if you are here now, keep in mind it's early and things will change.  In the near future, v2 will be much more `No-code` for users to build worlds.

However, one of the amazing and fun aspects of Hyperfy is the many skill-rabbitholes you start running down.  So don't be afraid, drop that `imposter syndrome` and learn some new things.

The community is always here to help.

## Prerequisites

- wsl2 on Windows
- `nvm` - Node version manager
- Node v22.11.0
- git
- Xcode Command Line Tools on Mac
- a web browser

---

<Aside title="WSL2 Recommended">
On Windows?  Install WSL2. WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux.
<Icon name="linux" />
</Aside>

### WSL2

'Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", or Start Menu> start typing 'Command' > Run Command Prompt as Administrator

In the terminal that opens copy this command and hit Enter:

```sh frame="none"
wsl --install

```

This command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux.'

The first time you use WSL2, it will ask you to create a `username` and `password` for your new Ubuntu Linux Distribution.

This is a password that only applies to WSL.

You can now find WSL from the Start menu.  Or in the future, open Command Prompt and type `wsl` and it will switch to WSL2.

if you are working from Command Prompt, after typing `wsl` to be sure to be in the `home` folder of your Ubuntu distribution.  To do this, you can type `cd ~` and hit `Enter`.  `~` is above your `tab` key using `shift`.

For troubleshooting WSL2 install or to learn more about it, go to [WSL2-docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

---


### Node and Node Version Manager

After getting WSL2, you will need `Node` and  `Node Version Manager `nvm`.

You can first install `nvm` which will help you install `Node.js` and manage different `Node` versions.

in a WSL2 terminal, run

```sh frame="none"
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

```

`Node.js` is a tool that helps make websites and apps work quickly by efficiently handling tasks on the server side.

After you have installed `nvm`, you can use it to install `Node`.  Again in your WSL2, run:

```sh frame="none"
nvm install node

```
Once you have it, it's just a tool accessed in the background.  You won't need to ever 'open' it.


For Hyperfy v2, we want to use `**Node 22.11.0**`.  Now that `nvm` and `node` is installed, you can run:


```sh frame="none"
nvm install 22.11.0

```
This will install Node version `22.11.0`.

If this is the only Node version you you have, you are now on `22.11.0`.  To check or if you already have other Node version, run:

```sh frame="none"
nvm use 22.11.0

```

Your terminal should say `Using Node v22.11.0`.

<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />

If you get stuck with nvm, check their [repo here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

## Cloning the Hyperfy v2 Repo


<Aside title="You need Git.">

in WSL2 : `sudo apt install git-all`

on mac: `git --version`
If you donâ€™t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If for some reason you don't have `Xcode Command Line Tools`:
enter the command xcode-select --install in the terminal to begin the installation process. You'll see a panel that asks you to install Xcode Command Line Tools.

or check [git site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you have problems.

To learn more about what `git` is [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-git) has a great foundational 'course'.

### Cloning the Main Branch

Main branch is where current stable updates have been updated to.  `dev` branch is where the newest development is ironed out and eventually gets pushed to `main`.


```sh frame="none"

git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world
cd my-world
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

```
Each separated below for easy copying.

```sh frame="none"

git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world

```
```sh frame="none"

cd my-world

```
```sh frame="none"

cp .env.example .env

```
```sh frame="none"

npm install

```
```sh frame="none"

npm run dev

```
After above, your world is now running in http://localhost:3000/. Open in browser.

<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />

When your world is not running (you kill the terminal) you can change the `my-world` to anyname you want for your world.

Just remember next time, you will `cd 'new world name'` then `npm run dev`

### Dev Branch

To work from the `dev` branch:

<Aside title="Alpha Branch" type="caution">

This branch is development.  So it's most recent, but also continuous alpha.  If new, most likely you want to stick to [main branch](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git).

</Aside>


```sh frame="none"
cd my-world
git fetch origin
git checkout -t origin/dev
git pull
npm run dev
```
Each separated below for easy copying.

```sh frame="none"
cd my-world

```

```sh frame="none"

git fetch origin

```

```sh frame="none"

git checkout -t origin/dev

```

```sh frame="none"

git pull

```

```sh frame="none"

npm run dev

```

<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />
Your world is now running in http://localhost:3000/. Open in browser.
