This will setup a world locally on your machine that you can then [self-host](/hosting/self).

You can start a [hosted world](/hosting/providers) from a hosting provider without needing to setup locally, if you prefer.

</Aside>


### Node 22.11.0

(eg via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating))

```sh frame="none"
nvm install 22.11.0

## Install

```sh frame="none"

git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world
cd my-world
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

```
Each separated below for easy copying.

```sh frame="none"

git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world

```
```sh frame="none"

cd my-world

```
```sh frame="none"

cp .env.example .env

```
```sh frame="none"

npm install

```
```sh frame="none"

npm run dev

After above, your world is now running in http://localhost:3000/. Open in browser.

<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />

When your world is not running (you kill the terminal) you can change the `my-world` to anyname you want for your world.

Just remember next time, you will `cd 'new world name'` then `npm run dev`

### Dev Branch

To work from the `dev` branch:

<Aside title="Alpha Branch" type="caution">

This branch is development.  So it's most recent, but also continuous alpha.  If new, most likely you want to stick to [main branch](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git).

</Aside>


```sh frame="none"
cd my-world
git fetch origin
git checkout -t origin/dev
git pull
```
Each separated below for easy copying.

```sh frame="none"
cd my-world

```

```sh frame="none"

git fetch origin

```

```sh frame="none"

git checkout -t origin/dev

```

```sh frame="none"

git pull

```

```sh frame="none"

npm run dev

```
