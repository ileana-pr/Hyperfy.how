## Is Hyperfy free?

Yes it's free and open source.  Once you are ready to share your v2 world with others that can join, the world will need to be [self-hosted](/hosting/self) or[provider-hosted](/hosting/provider).  This is the only cost associated, but you can find many ways to do this.  Some even free.

## What's the difference between v1 and v2?

v1 was hosted by Hyperfy via a one-time world purchase as NFT on Ethereum. The code was closed mostly.

v2 is open-source and hosted by you or a chosen provider.  The only cost is the hosting you choose.

## Where do I get started in v2?

`clone` the repo and build a local world. [Quick Start](/setup/quickstart)

## What if I don't know coding?

Check out the [detailed-installation] to get you setup with everything you need.
Hyperfy v2 is currently in development, but aims to make it as no-code as possible for future users.  If you want to start now, there is much support and you can learn some new skills along the way.  Once your world is setup locally, you can do alot right drag and drop.

We are currently making a [Video-Series](/community/tutorials) starting from the basics.

## Is there a Sandbox?  I want to first see what v2 world is like.

Yes! There is a running sandbox of current `dev branch` of Hyperfy v2.
