Hyperfy is an open source game-engine currently in Early Access expanding on the power of browser-based Threejs and PhysX.

Collaboratively develop and build virtual worlds, 3d games, immersive experiences, and the open-interoperable metaverse accessible on *any* device including mobile and virtual reality.

Develop your experiences on your own self hosted exclusive projects or use the hosting services within the Hyperfy eco system. Hyperfy is building a launchpad, empowering all to join the movement.
