## Beacon by Zesty

<LinkCard title="Spatial Beacon on Zesty GitHub" href="https://github.com/zestyxyz/beacon" />


### Distributed Spatial Internet Graph Beacon
Adding the beacon will get your spatial web app discovered across a distributed network of spatial internet graphs.

### Current Functionality
As of today, the beacon simply sends some basic metadata about the embedding app (name, description, and URL) to a specified relay endpoint for indexing.


### Relay

<LinkCard title="relay.zesty.xyz" href="https://relay.zesty.xyz/" />


'This is a deployment of a Spatial Internet Graph Relay, which helps to catalogue spatial experiences on the web, currently maintained by [Zesty](https://www.zesty.xyz/).'

[Zesty Docs](https://docs.zesty.xyz/graph/overview) and the vision-forward infrastructure for a more open spatial internet, called the Distributed Spatial Internet Graph. (DSIG)

### Drag 'n drop Beacon into your Hyperfy v2 world
