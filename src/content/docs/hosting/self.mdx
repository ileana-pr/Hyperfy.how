'Self-hosting' means that you are in control of the server and need to get it started yourself.

For a more hands-off approach, and to have it hosted by others for a cost, check out:

```

### Follow Fly.io Quick start

<LinkCard title="Install the Fly.io CLI" href="https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/launch/" />

This will help you make an account on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) and install the Fly CLI, so `fly` commands will work.

In the terminal `cd my-world` and run `fly launch`

It most likely will auto-run `fly deploy` as well.  If prompted after `fly launch`, run `fly deploy`.

Your world will deploy to https://[yourappname].fly.dev.
<Badge text="Success" variant="success" />

The next time you want to update deployment, run `fly deploy`.

### Custom Domain
To add custom domain follow their [docs](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domain/)  *Cloudfare seems to have issues, check their tips*

## Coolify Installation Guide:
**From Zero to Hyper Cool - [guide by Howie Duhzit](https://github.com/howieduhzit)**

<Badge text="Free" variant="caution" />

An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.

<LinkPreview id="https://coolify.io/" />

## Prerequisites

### 1. Purchase a Domain Name
- **Recommended**: [Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com/) - offers simple domain registration with competitive pricing
- Other options:
  - Namecheap
  - GoDaddy
  - Google Domains
  - Cloudflare Registrar
- Select and purchase your preferred domain name
- Make sure you have access to the domain's DNS management panel

### 2. Acquire a Host/Server
- **Recommended**: [Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com/) - provides reliable VPS hosting with excellent performance for Coolify deployments
- Other quality VPS providers:
  - DigitalOcean
  - Linode/Akamai
  - AWS
  - Vultr
  - Hetzner

- Minimum specifications:
  - At least 2GB RAM
  - 1+ CPU cores
  - 20+ GB SSD storage
  - Ubuntu 20.04 or newer recommended

### 3. Configure DNS Records
1. Log in to your domain registrar's DNS management panel
2. Create an A record for the root domain (`@`):
   - Type: A
   - Name: `@` (represents the root domain)
   - Value: Your server's IP address (e.g., `203.0.113.1`)
   - TTL: 60 (or lowest)

3. Create a wildcard A record to point all subdomains to the same server:
   - Type: A
   - Name: `*` (represents all possible subdomains)
   - Value: Your server's IP address (same as above)
   - TTL: 60 (or lowest)

#### Example DNS Configuration:

```sh frame="none"
Type    Name    Value           TTL
A       @       203.0.113.1     60 (or lowest)
A       *       203.0.113.1     60 (or lowest)
```

This configuration ensures that:
- Your main domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) points to your server
- All subdomains (e.g., `cool.yourdomain.com`, `app.yourdomain.com`) also point to the same server

> **Note:** DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours to propagate globally. You can verify propagation using tools like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).

## Installing Coolify
1. Install Coolify on your server:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```
   *Reference: [Official Coolify Documentation](https://coolify.io/docs/installation)*

2. Connect to the Coolify interface via https://[YOUR_SERVER_IP]:8000 and create your admin user

3. (OPTIONAL)Configure your host SSH port to match your host if needed, and add the following to Coolify's Caddy Dynamic proxy:
     *MAKE SURE THIS IS CORRECT BEFORE SAVING!!! EDITING THIS AFTER IS NOT EASY*
   ```
   https://cool.yourdomain.com {
       handle /app/* {
           reverse_proxy coolify-realtime:6001
       }
       handle /terminal/ws {
           reverse_proxy coolify-realtime:6002
       }
       reverse_proxy coolify:8080
   }
   ```
  Now you can access Coolify through your newly configured domain cool.yourdomain.com

## Setting Up Hyperfy
1. In the Coolify dashboard, create a new Project
2. Select the production environment

## VPS


### Deploying Your Hyperfy World -guide by peezy

<Aside type="tip">
This guide will walk you through deploying your Hyperfy world on a VPS. Don't worry if you're new to server deployment - we'll go through it step by step!
</Aside>


### Initial VPS Setup

Before connecting to your VPS, you need to upload an SSH key to your provider's platform.

```sh frame="none"
# Generate an SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Display your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   # On Mac/Linux
# or
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub   # On Windows PowerShell
```

Copy the entire key and add it to your VPS provider's dashboard.

### Setting Up Your Server

#### 1. Initial Connection
```sh frame="none"
# Connect to your VPS as root
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

#### 2. Create a Deployment User
```sh frame="none"
# Create new user (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your preferred username)
adduser YOUR_USERNAME
usermod -aG sudo YOUR_USERNAME

# Set up SSH for the new user
mkdir -p /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh
cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh/
chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Exit and reconnect as your user
exit
ssh YOUR_USERNAME@your_server_ip
```

#### 3. Secure the SSH Configuration

After verifying you can log in as your user, secure the SSH service:

```sh frame="none"
# Make a backup of the original configuration
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak

# Edit the SSH configuration
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make the following changes in the configuration file:
```sh frame="none"
# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Disable password authentication
PasswordAuthentication no

# Enable public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Specify which users can connect via SSH
AllowUsers YOUR_USERNAME

# Optional but recommended: Limit SSH access attempts
MaxAuthTries 3
```

Apply the changes:
```sh frame="none"
# Test the configuration for syntax errors
sudo sshd -t

# Restart the SSH service
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
<Aside type="caution">
Important: Before closing your current SSH session:
1. Open a new terminal
2. Try to connect with the new configuration
3. Make sure it works before closing your working session
</Aside>


If something goes wrong, you can restore the backup:
```sh frame="none"
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### 4. Install Node.js Via NVM
```sh frame="none"
# Install required build tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential

# Install NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Load NVM (or reconnect to your server)
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Install required Node version (22.11.0+)
nvm install 22

# Set as default
nvm alias default 22
```

#### 4. Install PM2 and Nginx
```sh frame="none"
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Install Nginx
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

### Deploying Your Hyperfy World

#### 1. Clone and Setup Your World
```sh frame="none"
# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world
cd my-world

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

change the environment variables to point to your domain url

```sh frame="none"
# Edit your environment file
nano .env
```

```sh frame="none"
PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/ws
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api
PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/assets
```

#### 3. Start Your Application with PM2
```sh frame="none"
# Start the application
pm2 start npm --name "hyperfy" --interpreter bash -- start

# Set PM2 to start on system boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

#### 4. Configure Nginx as Reverse Proxy
```sh frame="none"
# Remove default config
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Create new config (replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain)
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
```

Add this configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Change to your domain

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Change port if different
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

Enable and start Nginx:
```sh frame="none"
# Enable the site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Start Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### 5. Configure Your Domain's DNS

Before enabling HTTPS, you need to point your domain to your server:

1. Go to your domain registrar's website (like Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Find the DNS settings or DNS management section
3. Add or modify the following records:
   ```
   Type  | Name  | Value
   A     | @     | your_server_ip
   CNAME | www   | your_domain
   ```
4. Save your changes

DNS changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours to propagate. You can check the propagation by going on https://dnschecker.org/ and inserting your domain. it should point to your server ip

#### 6. Set Up HTTPS with Certbot

Let's secure your site with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt:

```sh frame="none"
# Install Certbot and its Nginx plugin
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain and install the certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com

# When prompted:
# 1. Enter your email address
# 2. Agree to terms of service
# 3. Choose whether to redirect HTTP to HTTPS (recommended)
```

Certbot will automatically modify your Nginx configuration to use HTTPS. It also sets up automatic renewal of your certificates.

You can verify that the SSL certificate is set to auto-renew by checking the Certbot timer
```sh frame="none"
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

#### 7. Configure Firewall
```sh frame="none"
# Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

### Updating Your World

When you need to update your world:
```sh frame="none"
# Go to your world directory
cd ~/my-world

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Install any new dependencies
npm install

# Restart the application
pm2 restart hyperfy
```

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

#### View Application Status
```sh frame="none"
# Check status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs hyperfy

# Monitor CPU/Memory usage
pm2 monit
```

#### Check Nginx Status
```sh frame="none"
# View Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

#### Common Issues

1. Port 3000 already in use:
```sh frame="none"
# Find what's using the port
sudo lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

2. Node version issues:
```sh frame="none"
# Verify Node version
node -v

# Switch version if needed
nvm use 22
```

3. Permission issues:
```sh frame="none"
# Fix ownership if needed
sudo chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME ~/my-world
```

4. SSL Certificate issues:
```sh frame="none"
# Check certificate status
sudo certbot certificates

# Renew certificates manually if needed
sudo certbot renew

# View Certbot logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```

<Aside>
Remember to check your application logs (`pm2 logs`) for any specific error messages if you encounter issues. Most problems can be diagnosed through the logs!

## Digital Ocean

### Deploy a v2 world - [guide by Ash]((https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/wiki/Deploy-a-world-(Digital-Ocean)))

<Aside type="tip">
This is a quick and dirty guide to getting a world up and running on digital ocean, using cloudflare to point your own domain at the world with SSL enabled.
</Aside>

### 1. Create droplet
Create your droplet in digital ocean. For this example i'm using a cheap $6/mo droplet which should be plenty for basic worlds:

- 1 GB Ram
- Regular SSD

Make sure to set up SSH access you can shell into the server.

Once set up, Digital Ocean gives you the IP address of your droplet.

### 2. SSH into droplet

```sh frame="none"
ssh root@<ip-address>
```


### 3. Create working directory & clone repo

```sh frame="none"
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git
cd hyperfy
```

optionally make this your default ssh directory

```sh frame="none"
nano ~/.bashrc
```

and add `cd /var/www/hyperfy` to the bottom of the file

### 4. Install node

```sh frame="none"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 22.11.0
nvm use
```

If you run into 'nvm not found' or similar, reboot shell or just exit ssh and re-ssh in

### 5. Configure .env

```sh frame="none"
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Change the urls to use the public domain host that you'll be setting up later with cloudflare

### 6. Install and Start the world
```sh frame="none"
npm install
npm run build
```

Also install pm2. This will restart the world automatically if it crashes for some reason.

```sh frame="none"
npm install pm2 -g
```

Then start the world with:

```sh frame="none"
pm2 start "npm run start" --name=app
```

You can see logs by running `pm2 log` and restart the server with `pm2 restart app` etc.

### 7. Setup NGINX

```sh frame="none"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/hyperfy
```

Paste this basic setup into nano, making sure to change your domain

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mydomain.xyz;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api/upload {
        client_max_body_size 50m;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Then symlink this site to enabled:

```sh frame="none"
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/hyperfy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Check the nginx is valid and restart nginx

```sh frame="none"
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```


### 8. Configure cloudflare
Assuming you already have your domain and DNS managed by cloudflare, go to the DNS page of your domain.

Add a new DNS entry:

- Type: A
- Name: either a subdomain or the full domain, depending on where you want the world
- Content:
- Proxied: yes

<Aside type='tip'>
That's it!
Your world should now be accessible via the domain you set up!
</Aside>
