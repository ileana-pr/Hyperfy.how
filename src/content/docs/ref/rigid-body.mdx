A rigidbody that has colliders as children will act under physics.

## Properties

### `.type`: String

The type of rigidbody, either `static`, `kinematic` or `dynamic`. Defaults to `static`.

NOTE: if you plan to move the rigidbody with code without being dynamic, use `kinematic` for performance reasons.

### `.onContactStart`: Function

The function to call when a child collider generates contacts with another rigidbody.

### `.onContactEnd`: Function

The function to call when a child collider ends contacts with another rigidbody.

### `.onTriggerEnter`: Function

The function to call when a child trigger collider is entered.

### `.onTriggerLeave`: Function

The function to call when a child trigger collider is left.

### `.{...Node}`

Inherits all [Node](/ref/Node) properties
